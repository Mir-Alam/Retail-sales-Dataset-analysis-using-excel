Welcome to the Retail Sales Data Analysis project! In this project, I analyzed a retail sales dataset using Microsoft Excel, leveraging various functions and tools to gain insights and visualize the data.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project involves:

- Analyzing a retail sales dataset
- Using Excel functions like `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `VLOOKUP`, `SUMIF`, and cell referencing
- Creating `Pivot Tables`, `Pivot Charts`, and using `Slicers`
- Adding `Commission` and `Total Sales` columns
